# shorting

This is an attempt to implement contracts that will allow users to short ERC20 compliant tokens
on the blockchain in a decentralized manner. The order book used to match lenders and shorters
will be implemented in a way similar to airdrop, and the logic used for the shorting will be
similar to what is found in the whitepaper published by dy dx
